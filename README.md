To compile ---> rustc main.rs

To run ---> ./main


To add Cargo to an existing directory ---> Cargo init

Root of directory ---> Cargo build
                       Cargo check

Another neat feature of Cargo is that you can run the cargo doc --open command, which will build documentation provided by all of your dependencies locally and open it in your browser.
